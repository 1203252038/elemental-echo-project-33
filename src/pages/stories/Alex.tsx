                  Present Day:
                  Moments ago, I logged off my last Zoom session with Ellen. 
                  We spent the last hour reflecting back on our three years working together and 
                  after I clicked “leave meeting” I noticed I began to tear up. 
                  To me, Ellen is so much more than an LSAT tutor and mentor;

                  “No matter where you are in life, if you tell Ellen what your
                  goals are—even if you don’t believe in yourself—Ellen will
                  believe in you.” <br /> <span className="font-bold">— Alex</span>
