                  Present Day:
                  Moments ago, I logged off my last Zoom session with Ellen. 
                  We spent the last hour reflecting back on our three years working together and 
                  after I clicked ‚Äúleave meeting‚Äù I noticed I began to tear up. 
                  To me, Ellen is so much more than an LSAT tutor and mentor; 
                  Ellen truly is one of my closest friends.

                <p>
                  His biggest hurdle wasn‚Äôt logic games or reading speed‚Äîit was
                  believing that dramatic improvement was possible. Here‚Äôs the
                  drill-by-drill breakdown of how he did it ‚Ä¶

                  ‚ÄúNo matter where you are in life, if you tell Ellen what your
                  goals are‚Äîeven if you don‚Äôt believe in yourself‚ÄîEllen will
