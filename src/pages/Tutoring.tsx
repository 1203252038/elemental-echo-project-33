                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Honestly, LSAT tutoring is usually somebody's side gig. Almost all LSAT tutors do it part-time. They are mostly reciting content they memorized from some book. They've never created a new LSAT methodology in their lives. There's a big difference between working with someone who can create new methodologies and working with someone who only knows how to regurgitate. Someone who can't create something new can't look at your situation, analyze all the variables, and design a specifically targeted new way for you to LSAT. That's what I do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A lot of people can get a 99th percentile LSAT score themselves. <strong>But you are not paying an LSAT tutor to take the LSAT. You're paying them to teach the LSAT.</strong> If someone does not have incisive communication skills, massive amounts of empathy, and an encyclopedic knowledge of what they're talking aboutâ€¦ it doesn't matter how many 180s they have. They're going to suck.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <h2 className="font-sybarite text-30px text-gray-800 mb-6">But do you really care about tutoring anymore, Ellen? You wrote The Loophole, so I'd think you're just living off the land at this point.</h2>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Yes, I care far more than is reasonable. LSAT tutoring has been my full-time job for 12 years. For the past five years, I have not taken more than three days off per year, and even on these "days off" I still corresponded with students. I regularly tutor the LSAT for hundreds of days straight. At one point in 2016, I actually counted and saw myself hit 97 days straight. I tutor far more than 2,000 hours per year, so the whole 10,000 hours thing is ancient history at this point. Also, I only tutor the LSAT. Helping students with the LSAT is my whole daily world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Let me give you an example. I had double hernia surgery in 2017; I tutored the LSAT for 11 hours straight 20 hours after getting out of the hospital. I tried to schedule someone for the same day, but the student insisted I "needed to rest." What they didn't realize is that teaching the LSAT is by far the best thing I could have done that day even if I did need to rest. This is why I exist. There is nothing I am better at and there is nothing that makes me happier.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="font-sybarite text-30px text-gray-800 mb-6">What does tutoring with Ellen look like?</h2>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Basically, I devote my life to making your LSAT life better. I do everything in my power to make sure that your LSAT prep experience is as awesome and successful as it can possibly be. There is no set formula for tutoring. It's not like, "Well, we've completed Module 3, so you have to move to Weaken questions because you should be getting it by now" (if a tutor ever says those italicized words to you, fire them immediately).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Tutoring is, above all, customized to your needs. There are many techniques I only recommend to students I've seen fit very specific profiles because I know those methods tend to work with that population and actively damage everyone else. These methods don't tend to make it into my books because of their potential for misuse when broadly applied, but they make a huge difference in tutoring.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="font-sybarite text-30px text-gray-800 mb-6">What's the structure of Elemental Prep LSAT tutoring?</h2>
                    <p className="mb-4">Tutoring occurs in two phases:</p>
                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2 pl-4">
                      <li>Daily Virtual Tutoring</li>
                      <li>Weekly Live Tutoring</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      It took me a little over nine years of teaching the LSAT to realize the ideal way to structure tutoring. In the beginning, we need to meet as often as possible, ideally far more than once per week, to ensure that you ingrain the skills needed to improve rapidly. There's a lot to cover, so we have to start with a breadth-first approach. During the latter stages of tutoring, we need longer, more in-depth sessions to facilitate the analysis needed to diagnose more persistent problems. We also need time between check-ins to get the LSAT data required for more persistent, intense problem solving.

                      Weekly Live Tutoring is when we can fix your most persistent LSAT problems. The ones that haunt your PT dreams. When we have two hours together, I can dive into your process with a dozen follow-up questions on every misstep in your thinking. This will allow us to understand the true root of your problem at a much deeper level than we can ever get to in VideoAsk. To get a sense of how this has worked, take a look at our <a href="/student-stories" className="text-[#F48487] hover:underline">Elemental Prep Student Stories</a>.

                      Weekly Live Tutoring is also when we discover new LSAT drills and methodologies specifically designed for you. <strong>My tutoring students are the root of every LSAT innovation I've ever created.</strong> When a student is stuck, I create new processes designed specifically for them to succeed. If the idea works well for them, I test it across my other tutoring students. If the idea works well across all my tutoring students, it goes into my book. Tutoring is the laboratory for everything cool.

                          "The best thing that has happened to me during my LSAT studying journey is picking up The Loophole on a late night before going to bed. Before I finished reading Chapter 1 I knew two things: 1) I need to find Ellen, and 2) my LSAT studying journey is approaching its end.

                        <p className="mb-2">
                          The second-best thing that has happened to me is actually reaching out to Ellen before finishing reading The Loophole. For the longest time, I have been struggling to have a consistent LSAT methodology. Tutoring with Ellen has changed that. I was able to learn so much not only about the LSAT but also about how one should read anything in life. I am sure the skills I've acquired through learning the LSAT with Ellen will benefit me in many years to come.

                          Congratulations on finding Elemental Prep! Your perspective of the LSAT is about to be fundamentally changed for the better."

                          "Working with Ellen's method, with no exaggeration, literally changed my life. Ellen understood that this test is a terrifying mountain that seemed impossible to climb, and she started with the very basics of the language before building up to tackling questions themselves. The LSAT was no longer something that could conquer me; it was something I could conquer myself. Ellen took that girl who had no self-confidence and helped her reach a 180 in a matter of months."

                      The rate for Daily Virtual Tutoring is $790 per week. Students must complete a minimum of six consecutive weeks in the Daily Virtual Tutoring program unless they are moved to a Weekly Live Tutoring slot before that time.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      The rate for Weekly Live Tutoring is $1050 per hour. Every Weekly Live Tutoring session is two hours.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Making every session two hours is a purposeful choice to increase the value of each Weekly Live Tutoring session. Most sessions begin with a 15-minute debrief about how the homework has gone and end with 15 minutes of homework planning. If sessions lasted one hour, that would leave only 30 minutes of instructional time, as opposed to 90 minutes in a two-hour session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I want to build longterm relationships with my students. That's how significant score improvements happen, not through a single session here or there with no consistency. The relationships we build through tutoring will hopefully last far longer than it takes you to study for the LSAT. I mean I was in a former student's wedding in India a few years ago. These relationships matter.
